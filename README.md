# Machine-Learning-Projects

In this Repository contains all my Machine Learning Projects, for better understanding i took all my ML projects in one folder.

In this Projects, I've applied so many techniques on data to get the insights for better understanding about the data.

### Techniques that i've applied.
1. Data Collection.
2. Data Preproceesing.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis.
4. Feature Engineering.
5. Feature Selection.
6. Model building.
7. Model Evaluation.

### Classification algorithm.
1. Logistic regression.
2. Decision tree classifier.
3. Support vector machine.
3. Naive Bayes classifier.
4. Random Forest Classifier.

### Regression algorithms.
1. Linear Regression
2. Losso.
3. Ridge.
4. Support vector regresser.
5. Decision tree regressor.
6. Random Forest regressor.
